I am a fourth-year CS PhD student at Northwestern University(NU) advised by Prof. Annie Liang and Prof. Ben Golub. 

My research interest is the applications of Computer Science in Economics. I apply data science and machine learning techniques to problems in decision theory and network of economics. I am also interested in model building and evaluation. 

I got my M.S. degree in CS from University of Chicago(UChicago), advised by Professor Ian Foster and Professor Kyle Chard. Before that, I got my B.S. degree in ECE from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).
